## Summary

Dan Kelley led a discussion of dealing with unfamiliar data of both textual and
binary types. The first of these used a "SPOT" drifter dataset as an example,
yielding code `spot1.R` in this directory. Dan made a video later (with link
given below), producing a more extensive code called `spot2.R` in this
directory.

## Plans

No decision was made on the topic for the next meeting, if one is held.  Several
topics were put in the github site as issues.  Some of the AMORE members who
were not present at the meeting have a need to understand how to deal with times
in R, and so that will most likely be the next topic, if enough AMORE members
arrive at the usual time and place.

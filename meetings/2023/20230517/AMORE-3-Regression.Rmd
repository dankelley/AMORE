# Assigning variables

Assign the variable $x$:

```{r, echo=T}
x <- c(1,3,5) #By value
```

```{r, echo=F}
x
```

```{r}
x <- 1:100 #By range
```

```{r, echo=F}
x
```

```{r}
x <- seq(0,2*pi, pi/16) #By sequence
```

```{r, echo=F}
x
```

# Plots

Plot $x$, $y$:

```{r}
x <- seq(0,2*pi, pi/16) #Assign x
y <- sin(x) #Assign y based on some value x
plot(x,y) 
```

## Plot aesthetics

```{r}
plot(x,y, type="l")
grid()
lines(x,y,col=2, lwd=3)
```

## Plot margin controls

```{r}
par(mar=c(3,3,1,1)) #A numerical vector of the form c(bottom, left, top, right)
```

```{r}
par(mgp=c(2,0.7,0)) #The margin line (in mex units) for the axis title, axis labels and axis line.
```

```{r}
par(mgp=c(2,0.7,0), mar=c(3,3,1,1)) #Ensure to call 'par()' before 'plot()'
plot(x,y)
```

# Linear Regression

Some brief, but important statistics background on linear regression:

Assumptions for the model of linear regression are primarily on errors. This essentially means that the average error is zero and the errors are independent and homoscedastic (uniform variance).

## Generate some data

```{r}
#Generate some data 
x <- 1:10 
y <- 2+3*x
```

```{r ,echo=F}
plot(x,y)
```

## Add noise to data

```{r}
noise <- rnorm(x, mean=0,sd=3)
y <- y+noise
```

```{r, echo=F}
plot(x,y)
```

## Using lm()


Suppose we want to fit a linear regression model with response 'y' and co-variate 'x' to the data we just generated.



Call the linear regression function 'lm' in R by:

```{r}
m <- lm(y~x) #Store the linear model output in variable 'm'
```

We can evaluate the output of our linear model by calling the variable $m$.

```{r}
m #Call and Coefficients
summary(m) #Detailed summary
```

Consider the statistics printed in the regression summary (residuals, p-value, f-statistic, etc. These statistics provide important information and are used to validate our regression.)

## Diagnostic Plots

For our regression results to be valid, we need to check our assumptions. How can we check assumptions on our random error?

Essentially, diagnostic plots are utilized to evaluate the performance of the regression model $m$.

```{r}
plot(m)
```

## Confidence Intervals


We cam compute the 95% t CI of the slope of this linear regression.


```{r}
confint(m, level=0.95)
```

## Extracting Coefficients

```{r}
coef(m)[1] #Intercept
coef(m)[2] #Slope

coef(m) #Intercept and slope

```

## Adding our linear model to the plot

```{r}
plot(x,y)
grid() #Add a grid
mtext(paste("model:" ,round(coef(m)[1],2), "+", round(coef(m)[2],2), "*x")) #Paste the model coefficients onto the plot
abline(m) #Add the regression line onto the plot 
lines(predict(m), lty=2, lwd=3) #Add prediction based on regression
```

# Non-linear Regression

-   Think first! Get to know your data. Plot your data and decide on good starting values before calling the nls() function.

-   Eg. Where $y=x^A$

    -   We can manipulate $y$ through log-transformations

    -   Let $\hat{y}=logy$, $\hat{x}=logx$. We can apply the log transformation to yield $y = A x$

```{r}
x <- seq(0,10,length.out=50)
A <- 1
B <- 5
y <- A*x*exp(-x/B)
```

```{r,echo=F}
plot(x,y)
```

## Interpreting common nls() error codes

```{r, error=T}
nls(y~A*x*exp(-x/B))
```

No initial value provided to the function

```{r, error=T}
nls(y~A*x*exp(-x/B), start=list(A=1.035,B=4.834))
```

Function fits 'too' well

```{r, error=T}
nls(y~A*x*exp(-x/B), start=list(A=1,B=40))
```

Bad estimate for A or B coefficients

## Using nls()


Suppose we want to fit a linear regression model with response 'y' and covariate 'x' to the data we just generated.


Call the nonlinear regression function 'nls' in R by:

```{r}
y <- y+rnorm(x,sd=0.05) #add noise to the data
mnonlinear  <- nls(y~A*x*exp(-x/B), start=list(A=1,B=4))
```


We can evaluate the output of our nonlinear model by calling the variable $mnonlinear$.

```{r}
mnonlinear #Call and Coefficients
summary(mnonlinear) #Detailed summary
```

We can perform the majority of statistical operations on nls() models that we can on lm() models:

##Extracting Coefficients
```{r}

coef(mnonlinear)[1] #coefficient 1
coef(mnonlinear)[2] #coefficient 2

coef(mnonlinear) #Both coefficients


We can compute the 95% t CI of the slope of this nonlinear regression.
```{r}
confint(mnonlinear, level=0.95)
```

## Residual sum of squares
```{r}
RSS.p <- sum(residuals(mnonlinear)^2)
```

## Total sum of squares
```{r}
(TSS <- sum((y - mean(y))^2))  
```

## R-squared measure
```{r}
1 - (RSS.p/TSS)  
```

## Diagnostic Plot
For nonlinear regression, we can only use the residuals vs. fitted plot to evaluate the model.  

```{r}
mean(resid(mnonlinear))
```

```{r, echo=F} 
plot(mnonlinear$m$fitted(),mnonlinear$m$resid())
```



## Adding our nonlinear model to the plot
```{r}
plot(x,y)
grid() #Add a grid
mtext(paste("model:" ,round(coef(mnonlinear)[1],2), "*x", "*exp(-x/", round(coef(mnonlinear)[2],2), ")")) #Paste the model coefficients onto the plot

s <- seq(from = min(x), to= max(x), length = length(x))
lines(s, predict(mnonlinear, list(x = s)), lty=3, lwd=2) #Add prediction based on regression 
```

## Summary

Dan talked about the use of base-R functions `cut()`, `split()` and `lapply()`,
with a general introduction being followed by two examples relating to the
timeseries of atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration, i.e. the "Keeling Curve".

Code for two examples is include in this directory.  But, please also take a few
minutes to read the essay by @monroe_history_2013 about the history of this
dataset.  That story has implications for science, of course, but also for how
research is funded.

## Plans

This was the last planned AMORE session for the summer of 2023.  That doesn't
means that members of the group are "on their own", though.  If the meetings
have been successful, participants will feel free to reach out to others in the
group if they need advice.
